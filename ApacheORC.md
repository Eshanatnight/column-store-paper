# Apache ORC(Optimized Row Columnar)

Apache ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) is an open-source columnar
storage format that was developed by Hortonworks and later
adopted by the Apache Software Foundation. It is designed to store
structured data in a highly compressed and optimized way,
making it ideal for big data processing and analytics.
ORC stores data in a columnar configuration, resulting in
improved and faster data processing and analysis.
It offers support for multiple data types,
including intricate data types such as arrays, maps, and structures.
ORC is extensively utilized in big data frameworks
like Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Hive for
performing high-performance data processing and analytics.
