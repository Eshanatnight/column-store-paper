# Query Optimization

In a columnar database, only the specific columns needed for a particular query
are retrieved from memory, whereas a row-based database retrieves entire rows
of data. Columnar databases can achieve faster query performance by retrieving
only relevant data and avoiding irrelevant data.
This is possible due to the way data is organized and managed by columns.

Additionally, columnar databases use advanced compression techniques like
run-length encoding, dictionary encoding, and bitmap encoding,
which can significantly reduce storage space and enhance query performance.
By compressing data by column rather than by row, columnar databases can achieve
higher compression ratios and faster data retrieval.

Moreover, columnar databases are optimized for parallel processing,
allowing queries to be executed simultaneously across multiple processor cores
or nodes, leading to even faster query performance.
